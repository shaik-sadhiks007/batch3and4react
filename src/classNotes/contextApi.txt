context api ----- is useful to send the data from one component another without parent-child relationship


1.to avoid prop drilling ---- if we have the some more childs(levels) without using the props we have to pass them

2. global state management ---

3. cleaner code --- reduce lines of code


steps to use the context api 


1. create the context api

import { createContext } from "react"

export const MyAuth = createContext()


2. use the provider in the app.jsx , and wrap it

 <MyAuth.Provider value={{hemanth,setHemanth}}>


  </MyAuth.Provider>


3. retrive the data from the context api

import { useContext } from 'react'
import { MyAuth } from '../App'

const {hemanth,setHemanth} = useContext(MyAuth)
