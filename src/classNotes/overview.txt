react js summary ----


1.usestate --- it is like the variable in the js , but to update the html content in the website we are using the usestate function instead of const a = 5 like this

2. useeffect ---- async functions calls multiple times to avoid those we use the useeffect, 

--- if you want to call only one time then use [] empty dependency

--- if the ur function call depends on the another variable like 

if the product category changes we have to call the filter function in such case use [variable] --- dependency


3. map() ---- same like in the js but here we have to pass the key value in the first line of html, so key is used to differentiate b/w the childs , it is useful to react js , not for us

 todos.map((ele, index) => (

                        <li key={index}>

4. usenavigate() === > 

where you want to navigate based on the condition then use this

usage : const navigate = useNaviage()

if(true)
{
navigate("/login")
}
else {
navigate("/register")
}

5. react-router-dom --- it is like indexing of book which says on which route what to show 

  <BrowserRouter>

  <Routes>

            <Route path="/products" element={<Products />} />

            <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
</Routes>


      </BrowserRouter>

6. props --- if u want to send the data from the parent to child use props

// sending
  <EachTodo
                todos={todos}

                handleDelete={handleDelete}

                handleCheckbox = {handleCheckbox}

                handleUpdateTitle = {handleUpdateTitle}

            />


// retrieving


function EachTodo({ todos, handleDelete, handleCheckbox, handleUpdateTitle }) {


7. context api ---- without having child - parent relation we can send the data
