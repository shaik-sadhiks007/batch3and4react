navigation in the react js will be handled by one package called react-router-dom

by default vite js won't install this, we have to install this package 

to use the react-router-dom for the navigation


we have to call the three function in the html those are browserrouter, routes, route from the react-router-dom


we will call this three functions to implement the indexing (like book)


we are doing the navigation between the components (not like js , in the js ,
 we have the multiple htmls, and we use the anchor tag to switch b/w them)

without having the multiple htmls we are doing the navigation by components



note : 

For nagivation terms used ----- for indexing like book front page ( BrowserRouter,Routes,Route)  ,

 to navigate that page we have to use Link tag
